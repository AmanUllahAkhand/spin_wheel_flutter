# 🎯 Spin Wheel App (Flutter)

This is a **Flutter practice project** built with a **Clean Architecture** approach. It displays a colorful spinning wheel with random value selection and smooth animation. Built for fun, learning, and UI experimentation.

## 🧠 Purpose

This project was created as part of my learning process to:

- Understand clean architecture layers (core, features, presentation, domain, data)
- Implement a custom **spin animation**
- Practice **canvas drawing** using `CustomPainter`
- Build **modular, reusable components**
- Prepare for real-world scalable Flutter applications
